          I am 14 years old and was born on November 24, 2002. I have one cat and one dog named Grizzly. I have 2 younger sisters and three younger brothers, who I enjoy playing outside with and doing art projects with. I go to Trinity School at Greenlawn, and will be going into my freshman year this coming school year.  My favorite subject is math.  When I grow up I would like to do something with engineering or coding.  I enjoyed learning more about how to code this summer and hope to continue to learn more about it.

          I like to play sports; they make me happy. I also like to text alot. My favorite foods are pancakes and cupcakes. I like hanging with friends and going to the movies. Sleeping in is what makes me more happer then anything. Cartoon animation is what I want to do when im older, I have a deep love for anime. Anime is like my life other then school, buying things with my parents money, and family, but if anything anime is what I would love to make when I am older. Drawing too, I draw on everything, literally everything, but I know I still have lots of learning to do.
